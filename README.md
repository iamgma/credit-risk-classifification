# credit-risk-classifification

Background
In this Challenge, you’ll use various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. You’ll use a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

Instructions
The instructions for this Challenge are divided into the following subsections:

Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets

Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

Predict a Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data

Write a Credit Risk Analysis Report

    -  Provide an overview that explains the purpose of this analysis. (5 points)

    - Using a bulleted list, describe the accuracy, precision, and recall scores of the machine learning model. (5 points)

    - Summarize the results from the machine learning model. Include your justification for recommending the model for use by the company. If you don’t recommend the model, justify your reasoning. 

    The purpose of this analysis is create a machine learning model that can evaluate loan risk. 
        - Accuracy: The model had 94% training accuracy and 94% testing accuracy.
        - Precesion: Precision of 1 for '0' means no False Positives 
        - Recall: High recall of 1 for '0' means no false negatives.
